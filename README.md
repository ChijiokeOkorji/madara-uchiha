Click animation displaying his various eye prowess.

This is a simple single-page animation made using HTML and CSS only.
I opted to create the various shapes and objects using the "div" tag only, to understand how to manipulate the page contents.

In the animation, clicking the pupil generates an animation unique to the current visual level.
Clicking any other part of the eye progresses it to the next level.
